# Development Guidelines

## Project Structure
- Keep application-specific code in the [app/apps/](mdc:app/apps/) directory
- Server configuration and setup should be in the [app/server/](mdc:app/server/) directory
- Logs should be written to the [app/logs/](mdc:app/logs/) directory

## Code Organization
- Use FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing dependencies
- Follow FastAPI's best practices for route organization
- Keep configuration in [app/server/config.py](mdc:app/server/config.py)
- Use type hints consistently throughout the codebase

## Docker Development
- Use [docker-compose.yml](mdc:docker-compose.yml) for local development
- The [app/Dockerfile](mdc:app/Dockerfile) is configured for production builds
- Make sure to update [app/requirements.txt](mdc:app/requirements.txt) when adding new dependencies

## Logging
- Application logs are stored in the logs directory
- Log files are excluded from hot reload to prevent unnecessary restarts
- Use Python's built-in logging module for consistent logging across the application
