# Server Configuration Guide

The server configuration is managed through several key files:

## Main Server Setup
- [app/server/server.py](mdc:app/server/server.py) contains the FastAPI application instance and core server setup
- [app/server/config.py](mdc:app/server/config.py) manages application configuration settings

## Running the Server
The server can be started in two ways:

1. Direct Python execution:
```bash
python -m app.main
```

2. Using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Configuration Details
- The server runs on `0.0.0.0:8000` by default
- Hot reload is enabled for development
- Access logs are disabled by default
- Single worker is used for development
- Log files are excluded from hot reload to prevent unnecessary restarts
