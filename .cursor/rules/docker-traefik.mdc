# Docker and Traefik Configuration

## Docker Compose Setup

The application uses Docker Compose for orchestration with the following key features:

- Container auto-restart policy: `unless-stopped`
- Environment variables loaded from `.env` file
- Connected to two external networks:
  - `mongo-net`: For MongoDB connectivity
  - `traefik-net`: For Traefik reverse proxy

## Traefik Configuration

The application is configured with Traefik for routing and SSL:

- Enabled for websecure entrypoint
- Automatic SSL/TLS termination
- Host-based routing using the `DOMAIN` environment variable
- Service name derived from `PROJECT_NAME` environment variable
- Application exposed on port 8000 internally

## Network Configuration

The application requires two external networks:
- `mongo-net`: For database connectivity
- `traefik-net`: For reverse proxy communication

Make sure these networks exist before deploying the application.
